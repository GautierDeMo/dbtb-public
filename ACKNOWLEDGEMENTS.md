# 🙏 Acknowledgements

We gratefully acknowledge the following open source projects, which have been instrumental in helping us build **DBTB – Team Builder eXperience**.

---

### 🔁 Directly integrated in our repository

- [symfony-docker](https://github.com/dunglas/symfony-docker)  
  → Used as the foundation for our Dockerized Symfony development environment.  
  The code was directly cloned into our repository. We have retained the LICENSE file in accordance with the terms of the MIT license.

---

### 📚 Used for reference & tooling

- [doctrine-helper](https://github.com/siburuxue/doctrine-helper)  
  → A powerful CLI tool to quickly generate Doctrine entities from an existing database schema.  
  We adapted our workflow based on its documentation, but did not include any code from the repository.

- [zsh-in-docker](https://github.com/deluan/zsh-in-docker)  
  → A handy Docker image enabling a fully functional zsh environment inside containers.  
  We used it for inspiration to enhance our development setup, without copying code.
